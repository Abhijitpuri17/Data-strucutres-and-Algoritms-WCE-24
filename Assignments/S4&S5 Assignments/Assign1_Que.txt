1.	C++ Program to Find the Square Root of a Number
2.	Write a program to check character entered is alphabet, digit or special character using library functions.
3.	Write a program which display a number between 10 to 100 randomly
4.	Write a program which accept a letter and display it in uppercase letter.
5.	Write a C++ program to implement the Number Guessing Game. In this game the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him whether the guess is too high, too low, or right. Once the player guesses the number, the game is over.
6.	Create a student class to enter and display information from user such as Roll No, Name, Address, Marks of five subjects and average (create five objects to enter and display data). 
7.	Write a program using class to accept 3 numbers from user and display largest, second largest and smallest number among three.
8.	Write a program to read 3 values of a, b and c and calculate value of X as
9.	X= a/b â€“ c
10.	
11.	Write a C++ Program to Check given number is Prime number or not using function.
12.	Write a C++ Program to find Factorial of a Number using function.
13.	Write a C++ Program to Find HCF of two numbers using function.
14.	Write a C++ program to find LCM of two numbers using function.
15.	Write a C++ Program to Find Frequency of Characters in String.
16.	Write a C++ Program to perform below operations (use separate functions for every operation)
a.	Binary to Octal
b.	Octal to Binary
c.	Binary to Hexadecimal
